// while 1734 will be shown in the right click context menu
1734="Pack files"

// The string 1308="&Rename" has been split into 3 strings because it is
// different in some languages:
// 1308 is used for "Rename" buttons (the text on the button)
// 1735 is used as the title in all progress dialogs (with percent bar), e.g. "Renaming"
// 1736 is used as the title of all the dialogs where the user has to enter a new name,
// e.g. in the dialog which is shown when a target file already exists, and the user clicks on Rename button
1735="Renaming"
1736="Rename"

// This string was changed: The text "Use plugins or" was added, because plugins
// will not be used either if you uncheck this option
