New in file *.lng:
==================
2050="Folder sizes not indexed! You need to enable this function in the settings of the tool 'Everything'."
5062="Change single button"

Notes:
====

String 2050 is shown when you check the option 'Everything' in menu Configuration - Options - Operation,
and the used version of 'Everything' is too old or doesn't have folder indexing activated.

String 5062 is shown when you right click on a button in the button bar, and choose "Change...". It's shown
in the title instead of string 5061, which is still used when changing the entire bar.
